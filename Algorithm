The Robot has 2 IR Sensors: 'ls' and 'cs' At: 60 and  90 degrees respectively.
(To detect the wall on its left side) 
The conditions are such: 
  If ls and cs are low , i.e detect no wall, then robot turn left.
  If ls is high and cs is low, i.e, it detects the wall, then robot turn right.
  If ls is low and cs is high, i.e, it detects the wall infront, the robot rotates to the right.
  If ls and cs is high, i.e the robot is at a corner, it robot rotates right. 

Using this algorithm the robot will follow the wall in left-right jerking motion.
